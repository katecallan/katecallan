# Kate Callan

Computer Science student at Colorado School of Mines · Class of 2026  
Interests: software development, security & privacy, data management,
networks, and computer science theory

I’m a CS major with broad interests across software development and
computer science foundations, supported by coursework in algorithms,
databases, networks, security, operating systems, and software
engineering. I enjoy working on projects that combine technical
problem-solving with thoughtful design and consideration of real-world
impact.

Currently: studying operating systems, cryptographic theory, artificial
intelligence, and mobile application development.
