# Katherine Callan

Computer Science student at Colorado School of Mines · Class of 2027  
Interests: systems, security & privacy, networks, and software design

I’m a CS major with a strong systems and security focus, backed by
coursework in operating systems, networking, cryptography, algorithms,
and software engineering. I’m especially interested in building
low-level and infrastructure-oriented software and thinking critically
about privacy and ethics in computing.
